# EDA Case Studies

This repository contains multiple exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks based on historical Formula 1 race data. Each notebook examines a specific question using basic data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization.

The notebooks are independent and can be read on their own.

## What’s in the repo

- Jupyter notebooks with EDA reports
- Supporting CSV datasets
- Plots showing distributions and simple relationships

## Topics covered

- Race wins by starting grid position
- Qualifying position vs finishing position
- Distribution of wins across constructors
- Long-term patterns in race results

## Approach

The analyses focus on:
- Inspecting and cleaning the data
- Grouping and summarizing results
- Visualizing patterns with simple charts

Conclusions are based on observed trends in the data only.

## Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes

- No predictive modeling is included.
- Findings describe correlations and distributions, not causation.
